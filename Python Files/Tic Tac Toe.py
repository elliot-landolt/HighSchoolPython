# PROBLEM 4 (Tic-Tac-Toe - 15pts)
# Write a Tic-Tac-Toe program that allows two people to play the game against each other.
# In turn, ask each player which row and column they want to play.
# Make sure that the program checks if that row/column combination is empty.
# When a player has won, end the game.
# When the whole board is full and there is no winner, announce a draw.
# This is a fairly long program to write (60 lines or so).
# It will definitely help to use some functions.
# I recommend that you create a function display_board() that gets the board
# as parameter and displays it,
# a function get_row_column() that asks for a row or a column (depending on a parameter)
# and checks whether the user entered a legal value,
# and a function winner() that gets the board as argument and checks if there is a winner.
# Keep track of who the current player is using a global variable player that you can
# pass to a function as an argument if the function needs it.
# I also use a function opponent(), that takes the player as argument and returns
# the opponent. I use that to switch players after each move.

# The main program will be something along the lines of (in pseudo-code):
# display board
# while True:
# ask for row
# ask for column
# if row/column already occupied:
# display error
# place player marker in row/col
# display board
# check for winner:
# announce winner
# break
# check board full:
# announce draw
# break
# switch player
